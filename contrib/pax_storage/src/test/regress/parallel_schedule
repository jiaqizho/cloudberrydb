# By convention, we put no more than twenty tests in any one parallel group;
# this limits the number of connections needed to run the tests.
# ----------

# run tablespace by itself, and first, because it forces a checkpoint;
# we'd prefer not to have checkpoints later in the tests because that
# interferes with crash-recovery testing.
test: tablespace
# ----------
# The first group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: boolean char name varchar text int2 int4 int8 oid float4 float8 bit numeric txid uuid enum money rangetypes pg_lsn regproc

# ----------
# The second group of parallel tests
# strings depends on char, varchar and text
# numerology depends on int2, int4, int8, float4, float8
# multirangetypes depends on rangetypes
# multirangetypes shouldn't run concurrently with type_sanity
# ----------
test: strings numerology point lseg line box path polygon circle date time timetz timestamp timestamptz interval inet macaddr macaddr8 multirangetypes create_function_0

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# geometry depends on point, lseg, box, path, polygon and circle
# horology depends on interval, timetz, timestamp, timestamptz
# opr_sanity depends on create_function_0

# Load huge amounts of data
# We should split the data files into single files and then
# execute two copy tests parallel, to check that copy itself
# is concurrent safe.

# ----------
# Because vacuum will detect concurrently running transactions, it is necessary to
# run this test on its own, or it might not detect the pages are 'all visible'
# ----------
# ignore reason: Pax not support vacuum yet
# test: disable_autovacuum
# test: vacuum_stats
# test: enable_autovacuum

# ----------
# sanity_check does a vacuum, affecting the sort order of SELECT *
# results. So it should not run parallel to other tests.

#
# 'rules' test is disabled in GPDB. Maintaining the list of views in it is
# too painful, and there are also errors because of cross-segment UPDATEs
# and functions.
#
